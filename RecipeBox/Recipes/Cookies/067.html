            <h2>Lemon Berry Cheescake Bars</h2>
            <p>1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs <br>
                5 tablespoons butter, melted <br>
                16 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature <br>
                1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, divided <br>
                3 tablespoons lemon juice <br>
                1 tablespoon lemon zest <br>
                1 1/4 cups heavy whipping cream, divided <br>
                fresh berries <br><br>
                Line 9-inch square cake pan with parchment paper, bringing up over sides. Combine graham 
                cracker crumbs and butter, and stir until well combined. Press crumb mixture evenly into bottom 
                of cake pan. Set aside. <br>
                In bowl of stand mixer, beat cream cheese, 1 cup powdered sugar, lemon juice and lemon zest until smooth. 
                In separate bowl, whip heavy whipping cream until it starts to thicken. Add remaining powdered sugar and 
                continue to whip until stiff peaks form. Gently fold half the whipped cream into cheesecake mixture and 
                place remainder in refrigerator to use later. Spread cheesecake mixture evenly in cake pan. Refrigerate 
                cheesecake at least 4 hours, or until firm. <br>
                Use parchment paper on sides to life bars out of the pan then cut bars into squares. Use remaining whipped 
                cream to top cheesecake bars then add fresh berries, as desired. Refrigerate until ready to serve.

            <h2>Easy Apple Pie Bars</h2>
            <p>7 cups Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored and diced <br>
            1 cup apple butter <br>
            1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract, divided <br>
            1/2 cup brown sugar <br>
            2 frozen pie crusts, defrosted <br>
            1 egg white <br>
            2 tablespoons sugar <br>
            1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon <br>
            1 cup powdered sugar <br>
            2 tablespoons milk <br><br>
            Heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease 9- by 13-inch pan with nonstick cooking spray. Place diced apples in large mixing 
            bowl. Add apple butter, 1 teaspoon vanilla and brown sugar. Mix until apples are evenly coated. <br>
            Place one pie crust in bottom of greased pan. Slowly stretch out crust to cover pan's bottom. Cut edges off if necessary. 
            Spread apple filling evenly over crust. With rolling pin, roll second crust to same size as pan. Place second crust on 
            top of apple pie filling and tuck down edges to cover. <br>
            In a small bowl, whisk egg white until foamy and brush over crust. In another bowl, combine sugar and cinnamon, and sprinkle 
            evenly over crust. Bake 50-60 minutes until crust is golden brown. Remove from oven and cool slightly before icing and cutting. <br>
            In a small bowl, combine powdered sugar, milk, and remaining vanilla, and whisk until smooth. Drizzle over cooled bars and serve.
