            <h2>A mother's sweet surprise: Lemon dessert Iris</h2>
            <h3>By Bette McFarren</h3>
            <p>
                <b>Ingredients for crust:</b><br>
                1 stick butter <br>
                1 cup flour <br>
                1 heaping tablespoon sugar <br><br>
                <b>Directions for crust:</b><br>
                Cream butter and flour, work in sugar. Spread evenly in 9 by 12 baking pan. Bake about 15 minutes at 350 degrees, or until light
                brown. Let cool. <br><br>
                <b>Ingredients for topping:</b><br>
                8 oz. cream cheese, softened <br>
                1 cup powdered sugar <br>   
                2 cups Cool Whip <br>
                1 can lemon pie filling <br><br>
                Beat together cream cheese and powdered sugar, fold in Cool Whip. Spread on cooled crust. Top with lemon pie filling. Refrigerate, 
                covered, until serving time. <br><br>
                This recipe is from Sally Harper's mom, Iris. It comes from the era before Cool Whip. Sally has updated it to avoid the necessity of 
                making your own two cups of whipped cream. She says the only hard part of this recipe is packing the crust into the 9 by 12 pan. <br>
                This was the wonderful dessert Sally served our Sunday night supper group this week. Even the people who did not usually like lemon 
                flavor enjoyed it. The original recipe called for Thank You brand lemon pie filling. Since most of us have never heard of this brand,
                we figured it might have been an Ohio company. Needless to say, Sally is from Ohio. You might remember her as your fifth grade teacher 
                at Columbian a few years ago. <br>
                We have one gluten-free member, so she just didn't eat the crust.
