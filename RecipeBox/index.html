                    <p>This website represents my attempt to recreate the recipe box many who visit this site will remember seeing 
                        in my grandmother's kitchen in a way that is easy to share with my family and friends. The idea of scanning 
                        all those cards and distributing digital copies had been floating around in my head for years, but as I'd moved 
                        to Denver and then Lincoln, I found myself in her kitchen less and less often. As she got older, and her eyesight 
                        failed, Charlene cooked less and less often, so I imagine those cards must have been pulled out less often as well. 
                        When I first had the idea, I didn't intend this project to be <i>in memory</i> of my grandmother, but as time slipped 
                        away from me, that's how it ended up. I hope exploring these cards and recreating these recipes brings memories of Charlene, 
                        Al, and the family farm to all of us who spend less time there than we'd like. <br>
