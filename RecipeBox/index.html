                    <p>This website represents my attempt to recreate the recipe box from my grandmother's kitchen in a way that is easy 
                        to share with my family and friends. I had a very close relationship with my grandma, and many of my strongest 
                        memories of her revolve around food and spending time with her in her kitchen. I've long been fascinated by the 
                        little plastic box of index cards she used to create some of the best meals I've ever eaten. The idea of scanning 
                        all those cards and distributing digital copies among the family had been floating around in my head for years, 
                        but as I'd moved to Denver and then Lincoln, I found myself in her kitchen less and less often. 
                        When I first had the idea, I didn't intend this project to be <i>in memory</i> of my grandmother, but as time slipped 
                        away from me, that's how it ended up. Now I'm making it happen, and I hope exploring these cards and recreating these 
                        recipes in your own kitchens brings images and memories of Charlene, Al, and the family farm to all of us who might 
                        spend less time there than we'd like. <br>
