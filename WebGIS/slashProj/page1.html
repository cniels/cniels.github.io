length completed their task of canvassing<br>
the votes given at the recent election. The re-<br>
sult stands thus:<br><table border="0" cellpadding="2">

</table><br><br>Over four millions of votes, cast in a few<br>
hours, have thus determined to a certain extent<br>
the destiny and policy of the nation for the next<br>
four years—no small or inconsiderable portion of<br>
the active life of any single generation. When the<br>
next cycle of our political existence shall arrive,<br>
how many of the active parties to the recent<br>
conflict will have disappeared from the arena?<br>
Some will have withdrawn to other pursuits,<br>
some will be consigned to obscurity by their<br>
fickle masters, others will have been called to a<br>
different state of being, by that imperious voice<br>
which brooks no delay, and knows no disobe-<br>
dience. For how many is this their last Presi-<br>
dential contest! Let us stand, then, for a mo-<br>
ment, and in this breathing pause of our rush-<br>
ing existence endeavor to take in the full sense<br>
of this great popular verdict—a verdict without<br>
appeal, without new trial.<br><br>Four millions of active, intelligent, free citi-<br>
zens have united in this judgment. No such<br>
spectacle has ever been presented since the world<br>
began to revolve. Universal suffrage is no nov-<br>
elty. Rome knew it; Greece knew it; France<br>
pretends to know it. But no country on which<br>
the sun ever looked down presented the same<br>
amount of freedom and intelligence as that<br>
which, in the main, characterizes the voters of<br>
the United States. Frauds are committed here,<br>
numbers of uneducated citizens vote there; but,<br>
as a whole, the suffrage of the American Re-<br>
public is free, honest, intelligent, and it is <i>uni-<br>
versal</i>. The demagogue and the political trick-<br>
ster may sing their peans on this theme, but no<br>
demagogue and no trickster can by any hyper-<br>
bole of language exaggerate the magnitude of<br>
the fact. A great people—rich, powerful, in-<br>
telligent—governs itself by consulting the uni-<br>
versal voice of its citizens, and that voice is<br>
obeyed as soon as heard.<br><br>The canvass has been angry and excited to<br>
an unusual degree. At no time within the mem-<br>
ory of the present generation have the topics in-<br>
volved been more exciting, nor the discussion of<br>
them more irritating and inflammatory; and<br>
yet, how complete is the calm that succeeds the<br>
gale! Four millions of votes cast—neither can-<br>
didate in a majority—the minority numbering<br>
upward of one million and a quarter of ardent,<br>
disappointed, and dissatisfied men; and yet no<br>
more resistance to the decree than if it were<br>
the award of Fate itself! No struggle, no com-<br>
plaint; no insulting exultations on the part of<br>
the majority; no humiliation or vindictiveness<br>
on the part of the minority. The one party re-<br>
ceives its triumph, the other party receives its<br>
defeat, with the temper and dignity of freemen.<br>
If this be not a spectacle honorable to the na-<br>
tional character—if it be not one gratifying to<br>
the lover of his race—if it be not congratulatory<br>
to the reader of the blood-begrimed pages of<br>
history, then we should be glad to see one more<br>
so furnished by our rivals of the elder world.<br>
We claim it as an honor, not for this party nor<br>
for that party, but as a credit to our national<br>
character—a credit to our national system of<br>
government. It proves that the thing works<br>
well.<br><br>In truth and in fact, the election is not the<br>
triumph of a party. It <i>results</i> in the triumph<br>
of a party, but it is the triumph of a far higher<br>
thing. It is the triumph of a principle, and<br>
that principle is the principle lying at the ba-<br>
sis of free government—the only principle on<br>
which a free system, as opposed to systems of<br>
force or of class, can exist—the principle of<br>
peaceful arrangement of contending forces and<br>
interests—the principle, in a word, of <i>Com-<br>
promise.</i><br><br>It is the fashion of young and ardent minds<br>
to look with contempt on the idea of compro-<br>
mise. To them it seems to involve dishonor;<br>
and in the heat of conflict graver and more<br>
thoughtful voices have sometimes pronounced<br>“the day of compromises to be past.” But<br>
these are the mere utterances of inexperience,<br>
or of vexation. When the day of compromises<br>
passes away, the day of force and violence be-<br>
gins; when the sun of compromise in this<br>
country shall set, it will rise on a scene of<br>
civil conflict, and, in all probability, of bloody<br>
strife.<br><br>This is obvious. In private affairs, in the<br>
determination of matters of private life, com-<br>
promises may or may not involve a departure<br>
from principle; sometimes they do—sometimes<br>
they do not. In matters of private duty there<br>
is a common standard of right, a common arbi-<br>
ter of morality to which all Christians appeal<br>
and submit, But in public affairs, in the man-<br>
agement of national concerns, compromise is the<br>
only possible alternative that can take the place<br>
of force. If compromise fails, force must set-<br>
tle it; when compromise goes out, force stalks<br>
in. This is the history of the world. All great<br>
systems have been carried on, every thing that<br>
is great in the organization of governments has<br>
been accomplished by large intellects capable<br>
of sufficient strength and sufficient courage to<br>
stem opposing tides. Whenever great disas-<br>
ters have occurred, it has been owing to the re-<br>
jection of this idea, or because narrow and pas-<br>
sionate minds have assumed the helm. The<br>
revolutions of the world which have changed its<br>
destiny form hardly an exception. Where they<br>
have succeeded, it has been because they have<br>
been, like our own, under the guidance of saga-<br>
cious men, who desired compromise and were<br>
forced into conflict. Such a man was Washing-<br>
ton; such a man was Luther.<br><br>Look at it in relation to religious affairs.<br>
In France, in the 16th century, for fifty years<br>
the Catholics had control of the government,<br>
and resisted all idea of toleration. For fifty<br>
years the country was desolated with a succes-<br>
sion of civil wars, until a great man arose, and<br>
Henry IV. compromised the question by the<br>
Edict of Nantes. That edict gave France a<br>
century of repose and order, until his royal<br>
grandson, Louis XIV., repealed it in 1689.<br>
The immediate consequence was the war of the<br>
Cevennes, the more remote that overweening<br>
power of the Church, which, in a greater de-<br>
gree than any thing else, led to the French Rev-<br>
olution.<br><br>In that Revolution again the wise men of the<br>
time sought a compromise between the prin-<br>
ciple of despotism and the principle of abso-<br>
lute freedom. It was rejected, scouted, derided.<br>
What followed? Seventy years of war, mur-<br>
der, rapine, revolution; and now, at the end of<br>
those seventy years, the gallant nation is borne<br>
down by a tyranny more ignoble than any that<br>
preceded it.<br><br>On the other hand, look at England. What<br>
has made the career of that people so steady and<br>
so successful? It is compromise all over—com-<br>
promise all the time—compromise every where.<br>
Their Church—how well Macaulay has put it—<br>
is a compromise between the new and the old<br>
systems of faith. Politically, their system is<br>
a compromise between feudalism, as stiff and<br>
haughty as that of Simon de Montfort, and a<br>
democratic element as wild and much more sav-<br>
age than our own. They compromise all the<br>
time. They cut off Charles the First's head by<br>
way of wholesome warning, and compromise on<br>
William of Orange. In this century the peo-<br>
ple lifts its formidable head, and before it gets<br>
fairly awake they compromise on the Reform<br>
Bill. Ireland, misgoverned, outraged, starved,<br>
appeals to the world, and the question is com-<br>
promised by Maynooth grants, and all sorts of<br>
soothing and pacifying measures. The only<br>
time in her long career that England has not<br>
known how to compromise was in regard to this<br>
country, and she paid for it by a loss and a<br>
sense of humiliation from which she has never<br>
yet recovered.<br><br>In regard to our republic, it is loss of time to<br>
show how eminently, how completely it grows<br>
out of, how it depends on, how it exists by<br>
compromise, and by compromise alone. If ever<br>
there was a country to which the idea applies<br>
it is this. Look at the wonderful richness, and<br>
also the amazing incongruity of our compound<br>
elements. Our climate reaches from an arctic<br>
to a tropic zone; our productions are as vari-<br>
ous. We raise ice at the extreme North; the ex-<br>
treme South sends sugars and oranges. At one<br>
extreme of the country the soil is tilled by the<br>
hardy offspring of the pure Anglo-Saxon stock;<br>
at the other three millions of African descent<br>
patiently cultivate the earth; while into our ca-<br>
pacious bosom pour eternal tides of Celts, Teu-<br>
tons, Scandinavians, Magyars—Irish, French,<br>
Germans, Swedes, Hungarians. Our religions<br>
differ as much. Every form of Christianity, ev-<br>
ery sect into which the great Church is divided<br>
finds here its representatives; from the con-<br>
servative Catholic to the innovating Unitarian,<br>
every phase of religious opinion is represented;<br>
while on the outskirts of our vast empire temples<br>
are raised to the impure deity of the Mormon<br>
faith, and the stocks and stones of Chinese idol-<br>
atry. Such are our elements. In climate, pro-<br>
duction, industry, race, religion—in every possi-<br>
ble aspect in which man can be viewed we pre-<br>
sent a diversity, an incongruity that no mind<br>
can take in, no pen adequately describe. And<br>
we would be glad to know, if this people, so va-<br>
rious, so unlike, so opposite, is not to be gov-<br>
erned on the principle of compromise, on what<br>
principles is it to be ruled?<br><br>This election has brought out in bolder relief<br>
than has ever been shown before, the true seat<br>
of the conservative element and governing power<br>
of the Union. The preponderance of numbers<br>
is in the Free States. But the controlling voice<br>
of the country lies in the great belt of Middle<br>
States stretching from the Atlantic to the Mis-<br>
sissippi—New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indi-<br>
ana, Illinois. The States of the Northeast, from<br>
their peculiarities of origin, climate, industry,<br>
and production, represent the extreme of one<br>
set of opinions; the States of the South and<br>
Southwest, from <i>their</i> peculiarities of origin,<br>
climate, industry, and production, represent the<br>
extreme of another set of opinions. The differ-<br>
ence makes itself most manifest at this moment<br>
in regard to Slavery, but it has been so ever since<br>
the origin of the Government. Upon the very<br>
question of the organization of the Government,<br>
in the successive controversies growing out of<br>
the old European war, the embargo act, the war<br>
with England, the tariff, the bank, the annexa-<br>
tion of Texas, and the war with Mexico, the<br>
same antagonism of opinion will be found be-<br>
tween the States of the Northeast as a whole,<br>
and the States of the South and Southwest as<br>
a whole. Sometimes the line is broken here,<br>
or the unity disturbed there, New Hampshire<br>
may be Democratic—Louisiana or Tennessee<br>
may be Whiggish, but, as a whole, it is an unde-<br>
niable truth that these two extreme sections of the<br>
country have always been arrayed against each<br>
other as the antagonistic representatives of two<br>
extreme sets of opinions.<br><br>Between these stand the powerful States of<br>
the centre, bound over to keep the peace them-<br>
selves by the very necessities of their position,<br>
and by those same necessities made stanch and<br>
unswerving representatives of the great ideas of<br>
Compromise and Union. A majority may swell<br>
here and diminish there. This time the whole<br>
country hung in suspense on the decision of<br>
Pennsylvania, and the result now makes it prob-<br>
able that no member of the dominant party, ex-<br>
cept a citizen of Pennsylvania, as prominent and<br>
popular as the President elect, could have been<br>
chosen. Another time the result will depend<br>
on New York, or some other of her sisters of the<br>
centre. But it is most manifest that in the<br>
heart of the country, as it should be, lies the<br>
great conservative element of our national ex-<br>
istence.<br><br>What, then, does the election show? Does it<br>
show a preponderance of one party, as such, over<br>
the others? The figures give any assertion of<br>
the kind a flat contradiction. The election is,<br>
as we have said, the triumph of no party. It is<br>
the triumph of the principles of Compromise and<br>
Union. It is a declaration by the conservative<br>
governing power of the country, that the vast<br>
interests embraced under this Government can<br>
be preserved on no other principle than that of<br>
harmony and concession—that the country can<br>
not be safely surrendered to the control of any<br>
abstract dogmas or principles—that as we have<br>
existed, so we must continue to exist. It is a<br>
renewal of the solemn league and covenant of<br>
1787.<br><br>In this decision the great Middle States have<br>
been conspicuous; the State majorities of Penn-<br>
sylvania, Indiana, and Illinois, and the Con-<br>
gressional district majorities, almost equally im-<br>
portant, of New York and Ohio, have determined<br>
the question. Whether right or wrong in their<br>
judgment, that the future alone can declare—<br>
but no one can doubt that this decision has been<br>
governed by a devotion to the great ideas of<br>
fraternity and union.<br><br>We entertain no doubt that with an immense<br>
majority of the American people, North, South,<br>
East, or West, attachment to the Union is the<br>
paramount idea. The Union is only another<br>
name for freedom, progress, and civilization,<br>
and as such it is regarded.<br><br>That the Union is to be an eternal Govern-<br>
ment, no one will venture to say: whether its<br>
existence will be of long duration, depends on<br>
our wisdom and virtue, under the government<br>
of the Great Power who, for his beneficent pur-<br>
poses, permitted it to be formed. It is already<br>
threatened by that intense love of gain, which is<br>
the peculiar vice of our age, which has sapped<br>
the source of our public virtue, and has lowered<br>
the character of our public men; it is threat-<br>
ened by the local jealousies of communities, by<br>
the local ambition of individuals, by the violent<br>
and reckless exponents of extreme opinions in<br>
all parts of the country, by the abolitionists of<br>
the North, by the advocates of the opening of<br>
the slave-trade at the South, by a portion of the<br>
press, by a portion, we are sorry to say, of the<br>
voices from the pulpit. These are centrifugal<br>
forces, in estimating the probable duration of<br>
the Union not to be overlooked or despised.<br>
How long they will be kept in check by that<br>
prodigious centripetal attraction which now pre-<br>
dominates so triumphantly, it is impossible to<br>
predict. The day may perchance come when,<br>
gradually prepared for separation, the States<br>
shall peaceably, wisely, fraternally agree to di-<br>
vide their common interests and to organize sep-<br>
arate administrations.<br><br>But at present any division would be like that<br>
which the lightning makes when it rends the<br>
oak. It would be death to both the fragments.<br>
He who thinks that a peaceable separation of<br>
the Union could now be made, is blindly igno-<br>
rant of the true state of the country. Neither<br>
North nor South, East nor West, would agree<br>
about any thing. We should not agree either<br>
as a whole or as separate parts. We could not<br>
agree upon the seat of government, nor on the<br>
division of the navy, nor on the appropriation<br>
of our custom-house revenues. A separation<br>
of the Union now, involves a total and entire<br>
reconstruction of two, or perhaps half a dozen,<br>
entirely new, distinct, and independent govern-<br>
ments; and before this shall be accomplished, it<br>
involves troubles, distress, and disaster, the like<br>
of which no eye has seen, on this continent at<br>
least. It involves fraternal discord and inter-<br>
necine war. It involves the beggary of the rich,<br>
and the ruin of the fair; the oppression of the<br>
middling, and the abasement of the humble. It<br>
involves the trampling under hoof of harvests,<br>
and the sack of cities. It involves a universal<br>
degradation and brutalization of all ranks and<br>
all classes.<br><br>This, then, is the idea of the election—it is<br>
Compromise and Union. It is a bold and united<br>
front to foreign powers; it is harmony and con-<br>
cession within. It is a protest against the ul-<br>
traism of all quarters, against the extreme opin-<br>
ions of all sections. Whether the result will<br>
prove that this spirit has taken the proper form<br>
and shape, God and the future alone can tell.<br>
But nothing short of mere partisan jealousy can<br>
refuse to find ground for confidence in the fact<br>
that the great executive powers of the country<br>
are to be wielded for the next four years by a<br>
man of approved experience and unquestioned<br>
sagacity, as familiar with the Old World as he<br>
is with his own; selected from one of the great<br>
conservative States of the centre, removed by<br>
his local position, his age, and his experience,<br>
from the extreme opinions of the ultras of all<br>
parties, and whose only possible real interest is<br>
to connect his name with the greatness, the pro-<br>
gress, and the happiness of the American people.<br>
If under these circumstances the paramount re-<br>
sult of Union, tranquil, prosperous Union, shall<br>
not be attained, why, at the end of four years,<br>
with our habitual good-humor, perseverance,<br>
and pluck—we will try it again.<br></html>
